This is a project on AirBnB_clone.

It explains bit by bit on how to create an AirBnB clone by putting in place the following setups:

a) A parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances

b) create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file

c) create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel

d) create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.

e) create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

f) Ensuring that all files are executable and should use the unittest module
